# Excel Course
I have recently completed my basic excel learning course offered by **Great Learning Academy**.
It was an excellent course suggested by my college- **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College**.</br>
Here is what all I have learnt during this course.
>Types Of Referencing
1. Relative Referencing
2. Absolute Referencing
3. Mixed Referencing

Referencing is a way to fetch different values from the given data using its index.

>Arithematic functions

1. Addition(+)
2. Substraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Power (^)
6. Square Root (SQRT())

These functions are used to convert your given data into your desired results using different formulas.

>Sorting

1. By Colour
2. By Values
3. By Font Colour

These are used for displaying your data in the desired form. Say you want the high scorers to be displayed first.

>Filtering

1. By Colour
2. By Values
3. By Font Colour

These are used to display only the desired data . Say you want see the data students who have scored 70 marks only.

>If Else

This function is used to generate a select response based on a given condition in case of a large data.</br>
</br>
For eg. you have a table containing marks and you want a text displaying "pass" or "fail" corresponding to it based on a condition say marks are more than 30 for passing. Then the code will be :- </br>
=IF(marks>30,"pass","fail")

>Logical Functions

1. AVERAGE (Average value)
2. COUNT (No. of values)
3. COUNTIF (No. of values with given condition)
4. MAX (Maximum value)
5. MIN (Minimum value)
6. VAR.P (Variance on given data)

These are different formula options generally used in statistics.

>Data Cleaning

1. Concatenate
   - =CONCATENATE(a+b+c) </br>
  Here a, b, c are values of three different cells
2. Left
   - =LEFT("Hello",3) </br>
   Here "Hel" will be displayed
3. Right
   - =RIGHT("Hello",3) </br>
   Here "llo" will be displayed
4. Mid
   - =MID("Hello",2,3) </br>
   Here "ell" will be displayed
5. Trim
   - =TRIM("  hello  ") </br>
   Here "hello" will be displayed without any extra space
6. Lower Case
   - =LOWER("HELLO") </br>
   Here "hello" will be displayed
7. Upper Case
   - =UPPER("hello") </br>
   Here "HELLO" will be displayed
8. Proper
   - =PROPER("Hello, how aRe yoU?") </br>
   Here "Hello, How Are You?" will be displayed
9. Find
    - =FIND("you","How are you") </br>
    Here 3 willbe displayed
    - this is case sensitive
10. Search
    - =SEARCH("are","How are you") </br>
    Here 2 will be displayed
    - this is not case sensitive
11. Substitute
    - =SUBSTITUTE("Hello there", "Hello", "Hi") </br>
    Here "Hi there" will be displayed
    - it is case sensitive
12. Replace
    - =REPLACE("Hello, I am Arun",12,4,"Aditya") </br>
    Here "Hello, I am Aditya" will be returned
    - it uses position and length
13. Len
    - =LEN("Bangalore") </br>
    Here 9 will be displayed
14. Char
    - =CHAR(65) </br>
    Here "A" will be displayed (ASCHII value)
15. Round
    - =ROUND(6.7845,1) </br>
    Here 6.8 will be returned
16. Floor
    - =FLOOR(232,3) </br>
    Here 231 will be displayed which is the nearest smaller multiple of 3
17. AND and OR
    - AND operator requires for both the given conditions to be fulfilled only then it will return the mentioned response
    - OR operator ressquires for either of the two (or more) conditions to be fulfilled for it to return the mentioned respoionse

> Tables and Charts
 - Types of tables
    - Table
    - Pivot Table
 - Charts
    - Bar Graph
    - Line Graph
    - Historam
    - Pie Graph
    - Radar Graph
    - Scatter Chart

   So all this was taught in only 1 week worth of self paced lectures. I found it highly beneficial and worth it. </br>

   Here is my e-certificate that I have received after completing all my lectures and giving 2 quizes :-
