I call myself an Introvert and am a quiet person in general. 

Currently I am pursuing a BTech. degree in IT (Information Technology).

I have always been interested in computers especially when they first took us to the computer lab years back in school. 
From quickly grasping the concept of Excel, Paint, Notepad, power Point, Word etc. 
to understand and quickly executing the basic HTML codes in class 6 or maybe class 7.
Who knows. 

This then lead me to opting for Informatics Practice as my optional subject in class 11 and 12.

Those simple MySQL and Python codes have today brought me to writing this introduction after creating my own github page. 


So that was all about boring me. ;)
